# Project Title
Project on Housing and Homelessness Needs of Vulnerbale Communities to 2040

# Description
Walsall Council needs a robust Housing Need Tool to inform key decisions and allocate resources effectively in the medium to long term. Housing needs vary across communities, with disparities in poverty, unemployment, and well-being. The Council seeks a data tool capable of predicting housing needs, capturing resilience, and considering opportunities and risk factors for a strategic decision-making approach.

# Project Issues
- Homelessness Trend Analysis: The project involves developing a data science tool (e.g., R/PowerBI) to analyze homelessness and housing needs trends. The tool will gather and analyze homeless data, using Census data and other sources (POPPI/PANSI) to make assumptions about the homeless population cohort. It will predict the projected homeless cohort for 2040 and beyond.

- Housing Need Trend Analysis: The tool will assess housing needs for key groups, including disabled individuals, BAME communities, older people, young people, refugees/asylum seekers, and domestic abuse victims.

- Risk Management: The tool will consider PESTLE factors and identify the top 5 factors influencing changes, such as government legislation, conflicts, and cost of living. These factors will be integrated into the assumptions, allowing the tool to predict the potential impact of external environment changes on homeless numbers and needs.
