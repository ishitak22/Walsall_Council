,,Background and technical notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"These tables show flow of households through the new homelessness duties since the introduction of the Homelessness Reduction Act in April 2018. It concerns only cases initially assessed as owed a prevention or relief duty between April 2018 and March 2019, and how these cases progressed through the duties up to a main duty decision, where applicable, at any point up to 31st March 2020. 

Flows do not indicate the length of time taken for each case – this varies, some lasting a day and others the full two-year period. As the prevention and relief duties are intended to last up to 56 days , it is expected that all cases that first presented in 2018-19 should have reached a main duty decision by now (where applicable). The outcomes for cases beyond the initial prevention or relief duty owed assessment will not match the outcomes in the published 2018-19. This is because the 2-4 month duration of cases means that many cases will not have reached an endpoint or main duty acceptance until 2019-20.

In this pack there are cohort breakdowns of the following circumstances of households that approached for assistance during 2018-19.

•All households(Any household owed an initial prevention or relief duty in 2018-19 that ended by the end of March 2020)
•Families (Households with one or more children)
•Domestic abuse (Reason for loss of last settled home)
•Single households (Households without children) 
•Single males 18-34 (One person households that contain a male who was between 18-34 inclusive when their homelessness duties came to an end)
•Single females 18-34(One person households that contain a female who was between 18-34 inclusive when their homelessness duties came to an end)
•Rough sleepers (Households whose current accommodation at the time of approach was sleeping rough in the judgement of the assessor)
•Prison leavers (Households whose reason for loss of settled accommodation was homeless on Departure from custody)
•Main applicants aged 16/17 (Households led by a main applicant who was 16/17 when their homelessness duties came to an end)
•Care leavers aged 18+ (Households with a support need due to a care leaver aged 18+)

Local authorities report whole case updates via H-CLIC each quarter until a case is closed. The data flows in this document are produced using the last reported version of a case. In some circumstances this means that the data published in the assessments tables A1-A11 may differ slightly from the totals seen in the latest data. This can be the result of a review of the decisions made on a case or for a small number of authorities some reporting issues. Reviews can result in more household outcomes than households in the quarterly data. Data omissions can result in inconsistencies between first reported and latest version of information on a case. For transparency, a quality section has been included in table F3 of this tables pack.

In addition to the above omissions data included in these flows packs only cases that followed the routing requirements of the H-CLIC data specification have been included. This means that a number of cases have not been represented where duties were owed or decisions expected but this information was not provided. These include prevention duties that have no end, relief duties that have no end and main duty decisions that were expected following a homeless relief that were not reported. For transparency these omissions are included in table F3. The routing pathways of a case are shown in the H-CLIC guidance document and the quarterly statistics publication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 1,"Prevention and relief duties owed following initial assessment between April 2018 and March 2019, as reported in Table A1. National and regional totals include imputed estimates where local authorities failed to provide accurate data for one or more quarters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 2,Only includes cases that have routed to completion - or a main duty decision if applicable - by March 2020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 3,"The combination of cases included and excluded from the flows does not quite match the reported total for two reasons: a) Initial assessment totals from table A1 include imputed estimates for missing data, b) The flows concern the latest data on each case, and therefore include some changes as a result of reviews or quality improvements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

…,incomplete or missing data in one or more quarters,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Total figures are presented rounded to the nearest 10 households.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Totals may not equal the sum of components because of rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
